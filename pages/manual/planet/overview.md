## About OLE – Building Open Learning Communities Worldwide

### Our Mission
The [**Open Learning Exchange (OLE)**](http://ole.org) is committed to ensuring that everyone—especially children—has access to **high-quality basic education**.  

We collaborate with **community-based entrepreneurs, educators, and practitioners worldwide** to promote **effective and affordable learning systems for all**.  

We believe this will lead to:
- **More productive lives**
- **Stronger communities**
- **Thriving nations**
- The possibility of a **peaceful world**

### What We Do
OLE’s mission is to ensure **learning for all**, not only through universal literacy and numeracy, but also by equipping learners with vital knowledge and skills in areas such as:

- **Nutrition**
- **Community development**

Since 2007, OLE International has:
- Helped establish **Open Learning Communities** for children, adolescents, and young adults

## Introduction

### What is the OLE Planet Learning System (Planet)?
**Planet** (Personalized Learning And Network-Enabled Teams) is a **multilingual learning system and library** with thousands of educational resources, including:
- Books  
- Videos  
- Educational games  

It also provides software tools for:
- Content and student management  
- Student evaluation and monitoring  
- Course creation  

At its core, **Planet is a repository of free, open access, and public domain resources** designed to support learners of all ages and backgrounds.  

Resources include:
- Subjects: **Literature, Health, Science, Math**, and more  
- Languages: **English, Somali, Swahili, Arabic, Spanish**, etc.  
- Formats: **Text, audio, video**  

### Flexible Access
- Operates in the **cloud** (online through the internet)  
- Can also run **locally** on a **Raspberry Pi server** (a small, affordable, low-power computer)  
- Works in **areas with little or no internet connection**  
- Requires **very low power**, so it can run even from a **portable battery (power bank)**  

### Monitoring & Evaluation
Planet makes it easy to track progress by providing:
- Frequent **assessments** for learners, leaders, and administrators  
- Evaluation of whether **learning resources are effective**  
- **Usage feedback metrics** (simple reports that show how often resources are used and how learners are performing)

## Planet Nations and Communities

Under the Planet system, there are two types of structures: **Nations** and **Communities**.

![Planet System Hierarchy Chart](images/planet-nations-tree.png)  
![Planet System Flow Chart](images/planet-nations-bubbles.png)

### Nations
  * **Nations** always exist in the cloud and require an internet connection to access.
  * Each **Nation** serves as a central repository for the **Community** or a group of communities that it serves.
  * Different **Nations** cannot connect to each other. 

 ### Communities
  * A **Community** is a local installation of the Planet system.
  * A **Community** does not require an internet to access.
  * Users can connect to a **Community** using any device with access to a web browser, such as a tablet, computer, etc. The connection is established via a router through a locally configured _intranet_.
  * Each **Community** connects periodically to a **Nation** via _internet_ in order to receive new materials and to upload user metrics.
  * A **Community** is not able to connect to other **Communities**. 

The **nations** may store thousands of Resources in many formats and languages. Unique collections of Resources can be selected and downloaded into each **Community** from the **Nation**. This gives a Learner a personalized approach to his or her education.
